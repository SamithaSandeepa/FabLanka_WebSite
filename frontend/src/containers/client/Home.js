              Fab Lanka is a group of highly motivated individuals coming
              together to set up fabrication labs (fab labs) throughout Sri
              Lanka as a community outreach project. The abundance of an
              educated work force, high degree of IT usage, and existence of a
              large number of small and medium size manufactures (SMEs) makes
              Sri Lanka an ideal home for fab labs. The benefits of bringing in
              new technology is the ability to transform the manufacturing
              sector of local economies in environmentally friendly ways. In
              addition, it will also strengthen employment for youth in the 21st
              century manufacturing job sector.
